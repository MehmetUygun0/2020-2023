## It's a bit different from the usual snake games.
Because there are two snakes. One of them we control with the directional keys, the other is a bot snake. 
- Bot snake has easy and hard mode. In hard mode, its only purpose is to eat the apple. In easy mode, it moves randomly. 
- Two snakes can overlap in the game.
- Whoever touches whoever loses.
- Snakes can pass through walls.
- Press the space bar and the game pause.
- When we eat an apple, our money increases.
- With this money we can change color or become rgb
